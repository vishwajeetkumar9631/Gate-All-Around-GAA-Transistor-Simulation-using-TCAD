# Gate-All-Around-GAA-Transistor-Simulation-using-TCAD
design and simulation of a Gate-All-Around (GAA) nanowire transistor using Synopsys TCAD. The GAA structure represents a cutting-edge transistor architecture for sub-5nm technology nodes, offering superior electrostatic control, reduced short-channel effects, and improved performance compared to traditional FinFETs and planar MOSFETs.
